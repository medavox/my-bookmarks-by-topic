An independent attempt to view the word for something in many world languages,
like I do with word-internationality.

----------

Very helpful in showing me which words I need in my language, as an absolute minimum. See also Semantic Molecules on that website.


[WP:Morphological Derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_derivation)
---------

Inspires an interesting concept: getting more mileage out of existing content-words by combining them with derivational particles.


[Crazy people who want to change toki pona](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewforum.php?f=12)
------

Official Toki Pona sub-forum on ideas for improvement. May have interesting ideas. 


[Nimi Pi Toki Pona](http://tpnimi.blogspot.com/)
-------

Informative blog by John Clifford about advanced concepts in Toki Pona.
Served as one of my original sources of inspiration for 'forking' toki pona.

plus evidence of deleted words.

-----

'Online Edition' of a 1935 attempt at an IAL.

[Lingwa de Planeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingwa_de_planeta)
-------

IAL created 2006-2010, originally in Russia, though now developed internationally.
Cherry picks words from most widely-spoken languages.

Consonantally too complex IMHO, which betrays its authors' Russian bias.


[Neo Patwa](http://patwa.pbworks.com/w/page/14800479/FrontPage)
------

Looks remarkably similar to (and is inspired by) Toki Pona.
Developed from 2004 to ca. 2013.
Pidgin-like. Intended to evolve if used.
